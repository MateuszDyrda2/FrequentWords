# FrequentWords
A Python script that, for a given text file, outputs a file containing all the individual words sorted by frequency

## Usage
To run the script from the console type:  
`python frequent_words.py -i <input_file> -o <output_file> [--type=txt|json|csv]`  
The default value for the type of file is .txt. The .json and .csv files contain both the word and number of times it was used. 
The .txt file contains only the words but they are sorted with more commonly used words first.
